Finding  doctors is hard. When I first moved to the US from France 4 years ago I didn't know where to turn to find a doctor. There are some resources like Zocdoc and Yelp, but who really wants to find their doctor from the same place they find the best taco truck? I developed What's up Doc to offer users a unique tool to discover physiciansâ€™ compensations from pharmaceutical companies. Intended to educate patients, this web app allows users to gain greater transparency and strengthen the trust between patients and doctors.

##### Backend

An interesting challenge I had was that my API was not always returning results even though it returned it in the past. When the attempt was unsuccessful it would return an empty list.  I realized the lack of consistency was coming from the API, and to circumvent this I created additional web keys and had the server choose randomly from the list of keys when making a request until the list received was not empty. I was able to improve the match rate from 30% to 90%.
